Ali comes back into the house MIRACULOUSLY WITHOUT DYING. My heart can't take much more of this. Ali chastises Nick for lying about made-up mental patients (NOT MADE UP) and Jason uses the moment to score a night on Ali's bedroom floor. Much closer and more comfortable than the bushes outside the windowsill FAHDANGSHO.
