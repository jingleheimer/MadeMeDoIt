Ali finds and loads a handgun, BUT THOMAS SHOWS UP, and Ali shoots him in the chest. BUT OH NO, THOMAS AIN'T DYING BY SOME SILLY BULLET. 

He starts strangling Ali, but NICK STEPS IN AGAIN and stabs Thomas in the stomach. A valiant effort, Nick, but your pocketknife won't be stopping this AXE FROM PERFORATING YOUR CHEST. He always was a nice kid.

But now Ali is back and Jason is probably eating a snickers somewhere and Ali knocks the mask off Thomas' face. (Damn this scene is going to be a bear. Not the huggable kind either.) Ali and Nick have a passing-the-torch moment while Thomas laying right next to them and Jason is WHERE IS JASON? SERIOUSLY.

Then Ali realizes that this is THAT Thomas, from high school. Then Thomas puts his mask back on while Ali leaves hurriedly.

ALI STILL WET(3). MOVES TO VERY DAMP(2) BY END OF SCENE.
